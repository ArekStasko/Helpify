## What i think about this app ?

I think that this app have huge potential that i can 
provide in the future, i would like to add posibility to create
the account and store data like places, routes, user statistics and much more in
the user account, i would like to develop this app in vanilla js, but i think i
also will make a better version of this map with react or angular.
